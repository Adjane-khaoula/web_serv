TOTEST:
test http status codes
multip servers
hostnames
default error pages
max body size
locations to different dir
index
autoindex
define certain methods for certain dirs
test each method
unknowen methods
file upload using raw body or form-data

simple cgi tests get/post/delete
The CGI should be run in the correct directory for relative path file access.
create scripts with errors/infinite loops and what not


headers should be compatible with normal nginx
